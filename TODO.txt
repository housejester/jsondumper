- Make escaping '/' in strings optional and probably off by default.  In reading around a bit, it seems that crockford has said it is optional.
- Fix date handling.  Should support timestamp and ISO string.
- Make decimal precision pluggable.
- Figure out if whole-number decimals should output the '.0' (do not currently)
- Look into moving some of the filtering into the actual BeanNameValuePairs so that excluded props get filtered earlier.
- Interesting idea from XStream:  render "Class" properties as "@class" : "classname here
- Add a SerializablePropertyFilter"
