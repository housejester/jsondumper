- Fix date handling.  Should support timestamp and ISO string.  Also support net.sf.json style dates as k/v pairs.
- Look into moving some of the filtering into the actual BeanNameValuePairs so that excluded props get filtered earlier.
- Interesting idea from XStream:  render "Class" properties as "@class" : "classname here"
- Add support for pretty/formatted output
- Make filtering 0's optional and not the default
- Move cycle detection setting up to the interface to be configurable.  Will probably have a config object (bleh)
- Issue warning if serializing Float or Double (recommend BigDecimal)?
- Consider making the jsonappenderregistry respect order so that Float,Double,BigDecimal can be listed before Number and get their own
 	appender (and the if check in the number appender can be removed).
- Remove String serialize(Object) from the JsonSerializer interface...move to a utility.
- Add CustomSerializerFactory with create(JsonSerializer, JsonSerializerSettings) for (better?) pluggable serializer support.  This would allow for the dumper to hide the notion of the walker altogether.  When a custom serializer is present for a class, then the dumper makes the node walker for that class a VISIT_ONLY one.  It could still allow a node walker factory to be specified, but that would be rarely needed...but convenient if you had a nodewalker for your needs already (like in Rally with TypeDef/AttributeDef node walker)
