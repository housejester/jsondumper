- Fix date handling.  Should support timestamp and ISO string.  Also support net.sf.json style dates as k/v pairs.
- Make decimal precision pluggable.
- Figure out if whole-number decimals should output the '.0' (do not currently)
- Look into moving some of the filtering into the actual BeanNameValuePairs so that excluded props get filtered earlier.
- Interesting idea from XStream:  render "Class" properties as "@class" : "classname here"
- Add support for pretty/formatted output
- Make filtering 0's optional and not the default
- Make unicode-escaping non-control, non-ascii-range characters optional (and not the default?
- Move cycle detection setting up to the interface to be configurable.  Will probably have a config object (bleh).
