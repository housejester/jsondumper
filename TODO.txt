- Fix date handling.  Should support timestamp and ISO string.  Also support net.sf.json style dates as k/v pairs.
- Look into moving some of the filtering into the actual BeanNameValuePairs so that excluded props get filtered earlier.
- Interesting idea from XStream:  render "Class" properties as "@class" : "classname here"
- Add support for pretty/formatted output
- Make filtering 0's optional and not the default
- Move cycle detection setting up to the interface to be configurable.  Will probably have a config object (bleh)
- Issue warning if serializing Float or Double (recommend BigDecimal)?
- Consider making the jsonappenderregistry respect order so that Float,Double,BigDecimal can be listed before Number and get their own
 	appender (and the if check in the number appender can be removed).
